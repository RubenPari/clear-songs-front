/**
 * Authentication HTTP Interceptor
 * 
 * This interceptor is automatically applied to all HTTP requests made through
 * Angular's HttpClient. It performs two main functions:
 * 
 * 1. Request Modification:
 *    - Adds credentials (cookies) to all HTTP requests
 *    - This is essential for session-based authentication with the backend
 * 
 * 2. Error Handling:
 *    - Intercepts HTTP errors and provides user-friendly notifications
 *    - Handles authentication errors (401) by redirecting to login
 *    - Handles server errors (500) with appropriate error messages
 *    - Handles network errors (status 0) when server is unreachable
 * 
 * The interceptor uses Angular's functional interceptor approach (Angular 15+),
 * which is more tree-shakeable and performant than class-based interceptors.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This interceptor is automatically applied to all HTTP requests via the
 * app.config.ts configuration. No manual setup is required in components.
 * 
 * Error Status Codes Handled:
 * - 401: Unauthorized - Session expired, redirects to login
 * - 500: Internal Server Error - Shows generic error message
 * - 0: Network Error - Server unreachable or CORS issue

 * Authentication Interceptor Function
 *

 * modern approach for functional interceptors.

 * @param request - The outgoing HTTP request
 * @param next - Function to pass the request to the next interceptor or backend
 * @returns Observable of the HTTP response or error
 * 
 * @example
 * // Automatically applied to all HTTP requests:
 * this.http.get('/api/tracks').subscribe(...)
 * // Request will include credentials and errors will be handled

   * The request is cloned rather than modified directly to maintain immutability,
