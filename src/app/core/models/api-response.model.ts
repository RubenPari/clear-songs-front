/**
 * Generic API Response Interface
 * 
 * Standard response structure for all API endpoints. This provides a consistent
 * format for success and error responses, making error handling predictable
 * across the application.
 * 
 * The interface is generic, allowing different response types for the data field
 * while maintaining a consistent structure.
 * 
 * @interface ApiResponse
 * @template T - The type of data returned in the response (defaults to unknown)
 * 
 * @example
 * // Success response with data
 * const response: ApiResponse<ArtistSummary[]> = {
 *   success: true,
 *   message: "Tracks retrieved successfully",
 *   data: [...]
 * };
 * 
 * // Error response
 * const error: ApiResponse = {
 *   success: false,
 *   error: "Invalid playlist ID"
 * };

 * Represents a user account in the system. This includes both database
 * information and Spotify profile data.
