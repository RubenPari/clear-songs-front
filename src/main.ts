 * Application Bootstrap Entry Point
 * 
 * This is the main entry point file that bootstraps the Angular application.

 * of the traditional NgModule-based bootstrap approach.

 * The bootstrap process:
 * 1. Imports the root App component
 * 2. Imports the application configuration (providers, routes, etc.)
 * 3. Bootstraps the application with error handling
 * 
 * Any errors during bootstrap are caught and logged to the console.
